Welcome!

This overlay is mainly for my own usage, though packages are of reasonable quality and do not conflict with the official portage tree if you use stable.

It contains some "restricted/unwanted" packages, a lot of Python, git and CLI libraries and tools, and some software I watch closely (providing always-up-to-date ebuilds): esniper, minbif, weboob...
