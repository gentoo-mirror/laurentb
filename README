Welcome!

This overlay is mainly for my own usage, though packages are of reasonable quality and do not conflict with the official portage tree if you use stable.

It contains some "restricted/unwanted" packages, a lot of Python, git and CLI libraries and tools, and some software I watch closely (providing always-up-to-date ebuilds): esniper, minbif, weboob, irker...

You can browse the package list: http://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/laurentb

This overlay is available in the default layman list. Just run:

    # layman -a laurentb

The commits should now be signed by my GPG key.

    # gpg --recv-key 0x3463EA5A518A9C75
    # GIT_DIR="/var/lib/layman/laurentb/.git" git log -n1 --show-signature

You can check the authenticity of my key by various means, including:
* https://laurent.bachelier.name/gpgkey.txt
* namecoin p/laurentb http://explorer.dot-bit.org/n/42712
* The GPG web of trust
